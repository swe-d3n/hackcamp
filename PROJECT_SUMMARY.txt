HAND TRACKING MOUSE CONTROL SYSTEM - PROJECT SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
A real-time hand gesture recognition system that controls the mouse cursor:
• Open hand = Move cursor (hover)
• Closed fist = Click

TECHNOLOGY STACK
----------------
• Python 3.8+
• OpenCV (cv2) - Camera capture and image processing
• MediaPipe - Hand landmark detection (21 points per hand)
• PyAutoGUI - Mouse control
• NumPy - Mathematical operations

KEY FEATURES
------------
✓ Real-time hand tracking (30 FPS target)
✓ Gesture recognition with temporal smoothing
✓ Smooth cursor movement with exponential smoothing
✓ Click detection with debouncing
✓ Configurable sensitivity and behavior
✓ FPS monitoring and performance metrics
✓ Emergency failsafe (move to corner to stop)
✓ Multiple configuration presets

INSTALLATION
------------
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run test: python test_system.py
4. Run application: python main.py

TEAM STRUCTURE (4 People, 18 Hours)
-----------------------------------
Person 1: Camera & Hand Detection (4-5 hours)
Person 2: Gesture Recognition (5-6 hours)
Person 3: Mouse Control (4-5 hours)
Person 4: Integration & Polish (6-8 hours)

TIMELINE
--------
Hours 0-2:   Setup & Planning
Hours 2-6:   Parallel Development
Hours 6-10:  Core Development
Hours 10-14: Integration Phase
Hours 14-16: Testing & Refinement
Hours 16-18: Polish & Documentation

CONFIGURATION PRESETS
---------------------
Default              - Balanced performance and accuracy
HighPerformanceConfig - Optimized for speed (lower resolution)
HighAccuracyConfig    - Optimized for precision (higher confidence)
ResponsiveConfig      - Minimal latency (less smoothing)
SmoothConfig         - Maximum smoothness (more filtering)

PERFORMANCE TARGETS
-------------------
• FPS: Minimum 25 FPS
• Latency: <100ms from gesture to action
• Accuracy: >95% gesture recognition
• Stability: No crashes for 5+ minutes continuous use

COMMON SETTINGS TO ADJUST
--------------------------
Camera resolution:
  CAMERA_WIDTH = 640 (lower = faster, higher = more accurate)
  CAMERA_HEIGHT = 480

Cursor smoothness:
  CURSOR_SMOOTHING_FACTOR = 0.3 (0.1 = smooth, 0.5 = responsive)

Click timing:
  CLICK_COOLDOWN = 0.3 (seconds between clicks)

Gesture stability:
  GESTURE_SMOOTHING_FRAMES = 5 (higher = more stable)

Hand detection sensitivity:
  MIN_DETECTION_CONFIDENCE = 0.7 (lower = more sensitive)

TESTING CHECKLIST
-----------------
□ Camera opens and displays feed
□ Hand is detected reliably
□ 21 landmarks appear on hand
□ Open hand moves cursor smoothly
□ Closed fist triggers click
□ No accidental clicks
□ FPS above 25
□ Works in normal room lighting

TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REF
--------------------------
Camera not found      → Check permissions, try different CAMERA_INDEX
Low FPS              → Lower resolution, use HighPerformanceConfig
Jittery cursor       → Increase smoothing (lower CURSOR_SMOOTHING_FACTOR)
No clicks            → Make tighter fist, adjust CLOSED_HAND_THRESHOLD
Too many clicks      → Increase CLICK_COOLDOWN
Hand not detected    → Improve lighting, plain background

SAFETY FEATURES
---------------
• FailSafe: Move mouse to corner to emergency stop
• Screen margins: Cursor stays away from edges
• Click cooldown: Prevents rapid accidental clicks
• Gesture smoothing: Reduces false positives

USAGE TIPS
----------
1. Ensure good lighting
2. Use plain background
3. Keep hand 1-2 feet from camera
4. Face palm toward camera
5. Make clear gestures (fully open/closed)
6. Start with default settings

DEMO PREPARATION
----------------
1. System startup (show initialization)
2. Hand detection (show landmarks appearing)
3. Cursor control (demonstrate smooth movement)
4. Click interaction (open file, click button)
5. Performance metrics (show FPS, latency)
